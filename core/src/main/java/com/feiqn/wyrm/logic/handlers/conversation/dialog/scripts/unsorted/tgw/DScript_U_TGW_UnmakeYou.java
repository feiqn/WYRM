        Through every once-forgotten truth you have unveiled,
        In every unwritten history you have derived,
        The song of the void has resounded within you.
        Each new revelation amplifies its power,
        Every moment which you gaze upon me amplifies its reach,
        And yet, so too, does it rekindle my own,
        Even now as you reach to grasp my existence,
        I am made whole again through you.
        You, who have come to know this unknowable truth,
        You, who now stand at the precipice of perpetuum and damnation,
        For the sake of all that still is,
        I must unmake you.
