Things I want to master before v2:

- UISkins
- JSON cutscenes
- Shaders
- Abstract classes




MetaHandler nests:
- AssetHandler (static pointer to game.assetHandler for consistency)

- InputHandler (?)

- CampaignHandler: (save manager; handles flags including cleared and failed stages, metadata, etc.)
-- ArmyHandler (death, recruitment, inventory, stats, other persistent Unit data)

- WorldHandler nests: (anything relevant to the specific screen / scene)
-- ConditionsHandler (environment and logistics, stage specific victory / failure status)
-- CutsceneHandler (triggers, stage specific prefab conversations, stage specific cutscene flags)
-- UIHandler (HUD, menus including MenuScreens)

-- GridMapHandler:
--- LogicalMap (WyrMap)
--- ActorHandler: (WyrActor, superclass for units, props, also bullets/effects(magic, abilities, etc))
---- PropHandler (siege mounts, doors, chests, breakables, etc.)
---- UnitHandler:
----- TeamHandler
----- AIHandler (executable action constructor)
