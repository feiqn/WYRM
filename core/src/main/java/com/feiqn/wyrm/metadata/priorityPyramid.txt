short term:
- cutscene triggers implemented into Stage_1A :: add rest if applicable and tile triggers
- more conversations / scripts
- rework WyrMap to populate from TiledMap.properties
- leif's stun effect
- continue building and filling out HUDElements such as turnOrderPanel with additional features and functionality
- more robust conversations :: map / camera focus, movement, action, etc. :: [cutscrene extends gridscreen override exitconversation]
- start thinking about 2A


midterm:
- examine tracking of campaign flags
- test combat for fun with high numbers and big groups
- hud polish
- consider refactoring recursionHandler
- fill out combat more (effects, etc.)
- the beautiful color-scheme in my mind (black, deep purple, gold)
- refactor SimpleUnit to use "Action ticks" instead of boolean canMove


long term:
- saving
- fill out more AI actions and behaviors
- find/generate more placeholder assets
- more tooltips and clarity of interaction for HUD
- refactor major systems for cleanliness, memory, and readability -- such as ConditionsHandler.calculateTurnOrder, and pooling for new objects


⚠ untested fixes
⚠ debug shortest path -- only for players, paths of length 1 or 2 get trimmed too short and glitch
⚠ debug combat micro-lag
