short term:
- debug AIHandler and SimpleVisualCombat interactions
- cutscene triggers implemented into Stage_1A
-

midterm:
- (Tiled) iterate on Stage_1A towards a presentable final product
- rework WyrMap to populate from TiledMap.properties
- consider refactoring recursionHandler
- the beautiful color-scheme in my mind (black, deep purple, gold)
- continue building and filling out HUDElements such as turnOrderPanel with additional features and functionality

long term:
- fill out more AI actions and behaviors
- find/generate more placeholder assets
- more tooltips and clarity of interaction for HUD
- refactors to major systems for cleanliness, memory, and readability -- such as ConditionsHandler.calculateTurnOrder, and pooling for new objects
